# Notes for M2

### Explication of schema fields types

- __ASCII Folding Filter__, this filter converts alphabetic, numeric, and symbolic Unicode characters to their ASCII equivalents, if one exists.
    - Makes sense.
- __Lower Case Filter__, converts any uppercase letters in a token to the equivalent lowercase token. All other characters are left unchanged.
    - Makes sense.
- __Stop Filter__, this filter discards, or stops analysis of, tokens that are on the given stop words list. A standard stop words list is included in the Solr conf directory, named stopwords.txt, which is appropriate for typical English language text.
    - We dont have stopwords.txt generated.
- __Snowball Porter Stemmer Filter__, applied a language-specific stemmer generated by Snowball, a software package that generates pattern-based word stemmers. Includes built-in support for Portuguese.
    - Dont need because main language is english (95%? of english)
