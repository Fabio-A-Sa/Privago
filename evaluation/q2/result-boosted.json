The location is quiet besides the tram, you can hear it very clearly. we enjoyed our stay very much",

Breakfast is expensive, I would recommend to go somewhere local place to have brrakfast since this hotel is located near French Quarter. Nice to have mini fridge in a room so we could store bottle of water and so on. Parking fee is almost 40 per a day, which is very expensive. We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with some great feedback. You're right, there are MANY, MANY great places around to grab breakfast and our front desk and concierge would be happy to assist you in finding somewhere that fits your liking. Thank you for staying with us, we certainly hope your Mardi Gras experience was a great one!See you again next year,Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager",

We had an amazing view of the park and everything was right out the front door. Club lounge provided great service and easy breakfast lunch snacks and drinks. Fantastic club staff filled every request. From the moment we arrived the doormen knew my kids by name. Gave us apples for feed the horses one night after a carriage ride. The ritz always does a super job for our family but these guys really have their act together!",

Cold water at faucet was warm to hot. Shower temp was perfectly hot. Would recommend more mirrors in room. A safe would be good addition and fridge. Enjoyed continental breakfast. Would stay at this beautiful hotel again. Thank you for the great review and your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans.

We appreciate all the great comments to help our future guests know our prime location. Having on-site parking does help our guests with convenience and our pool and courtyard are a great place to sit back and relax after a long day of touring.

The hotel is quaint, comfortable and extremely well located just on the edge of the French Quarter, so its very quiet but accessible to everything. We are in a King room, which is very spacious with a 3 seater couch, desk and shower over bath. Towels are lovely, though bedding is a bit tired. Rooms are clean and well appointed - yes, some of the furnishings are a little tired, but we feel that for the price, its excellent value. Service is also great, ladies at the desk and concierge are all wonderful. Would definitely recommend. Oh - and breakfast is a nice touch and hotel has fantastic wifi!",

The best thing we did was leave our vehicle parked. (There is a daily cost for this.) We were able to walk to Jackson Square and explore the French quarter. What fun. Our room was clean and the air conditioning was quiet. Breakfast was plentiful and relaxing, a great way to start our day.
