Service is great - the concierge provided a great recommendation of a restaurant and helped with a last minute request for a reservation. On checking out a few days later, there was a mistake with the pick up arrangement (made by another party) and again, the concierge helped sort that out. Housekeeping is prompt and very thorough, and the public areas are spotless and well maintained. | Would definitely like to return...",

Accessibility is the least to be cared about here as it is well connected to North Acton and Acton Town Underground stations. Helpful staff. Morning English breakfast was really good, a wide variety of choices available. The surrounding area is free of any hustle and bustle so extremely good choice for a person looking for a quieter area to stay. Numerous restaurants &amp; take aways present nearby. They provided me with wifi at a very low cost. Many small cooperative stores nearby. Room service provided daily. Only for one night the hot water was not available but the problem was solved the very next morning. I will definitely book this place if and when I visit London in the future",
