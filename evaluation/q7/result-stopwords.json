The rooms were quiet and comfortable. Our view of the ocean was great. There is a small pool and a little hot tub also. Parking only 10.00 night. The toiletries are nice. Across the street from Ralphs . Perfect for a few days just to chill at the beach. Many restaurants and bars walking distance. I have been there before and will continue to go there. Pat at the desk is very nice.We are so glad to be your hotel of choice when you come to stay on the beach in San Diego! We look forward to having you back soon!",

The Hotel may not be on the beach line, but it doesn't need to be as it feels so close.Would certainly stay there again. Aloha Kevin G!Thank you for choosing to stay with us at the Shoreline during your recent vacation. We're happy that the hotels centralized location worked well for you and the activities that you had during your stay being that we are just a stones throw away from the beach and Waikikis shops and restaurants.

My only criticism would be the lack of coffee makers in the rooms. The restaurants in the hotel are great, as is the gym. While the pool is nice, the beach is not an ocean beach, so be sure to manage your expectations. The service is excellent throughout the hotel. Also, be sure to be aware of the location - it is near downtown, but everything else (South Beach, etc.) is a ride.",

The hotel is at least 15 minutes away from beach not including traffic (30 minutes with traffic). Parking is ridiculous so the additional 20 a day for parking is worth it versus the risk of being towed overnight for 200. Overall the condo was awesome for the extremely low price and I will recommend to anyone who is vacationing on a budget. Dear Christina E, We are sorry for any inconveniences, we do charge parking as around brickell there is not enough parking, the hotels near by charge up to 30 per night. we are glad you enjoyed your stay and we hope to see you again.",

Even with the substantial road construction currently taking place in downtown Miami, this hotel is Worth it!! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and found the location perfect (it's about 15-20 minutes. Drive to south beach...depending on bridge traffic). The mandarin oriental is a world class hotel chain and this location does not disappoint.

That means it is in an urban setting. It sits on the bay, so it is somewhat removed from the urban hustle. Yes, it has a nice pool, but there are no beaches, and the views are of either the bay in one direction, or the city scape in the other. The rooms are perfect in every detail.
