      "We had looked around the area for an affordable yet clean hotel during our trips to Disneyland. We tend to stay overnight at least once a month in the area. We had stayed in several of the neighboring hotels and found them to be acceptable. In December of 2102 I booked several rooms at the Del Sol Inn for our family. I was very pleased with the staff during our check in process, who made us feel welcome. They were also very accommodating with our large group. The rooms are large and clean. The parking is good and the pool is very nice. Over all I have returned to the Del Sol Inn twice more and plan to us this as our favorite area hotel. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.",
      "Went to San Diego to drop our daughter off at college. Hilton Garden Inn was by far the best value. We stayed three nights. Centrally located, quite, freeway accessible and a great staff. Room was large as we had four in our family. Pool and workout space were great. Ate two nights at the restrauant as we were so busy. Happy hour was a little expensive but not compared to other hotels I guess. Will be back. Dear Joe F, Thank you for your wonderful review of the Hilton Garden Inn San Diego Mission Valley Stadium! We are so proud to have a great team of associates who are eager to provide our guests with top notch service. We hope to become your favorite destination when your business or leisure bring you to San Diego! Take care till next time!Warm regards,Sammie",

      "Fantastic location, reasonable price, and helpful staff made London the favorite stop during our European trek. | Mr. Rees, his family, and staff could not have been more helpful. We stayed in the hotel the nights of Christmas eve and Christmas. What a wonderful surprise when Mrs. Rees came to our room on Christmas eve with several presents and treats! It was very heartwarming, especially since we missed being with the rest of our family on the holiday. | The hot breakfast was great (thankfully, no beans!). My sons and I had to leave very early on 26-Dec and the staff came in early just to prepare our breakfast. What service! | Hotel is in a perfect location to see everything in London. Close to the tube system, as well as the Pancras train station. | Thank you to the Rees family and the whole staff at the Ridgemount Hotel!",
      "We visited here as a family at Easter . The service was fabulous from everybody we came into contact with . We actually took afternoon tea which was a relaxed affair and not rushed. I've had afternoon tea both here and the Ritz this year and this was by far my favourite | The cakes were more interesting the bread not dry , also although you have an allotted time in both . You do not feel rushed at the savoy the turning if tables is far more subtle | The savoy currently have a fab rate on suites . Stay two nights and the second night is PS20.15 .

(Jetlag sucks!) luckily the room had a superb set of blinds turning a sunny day into a pitch black night. 45 park lane is an excellent choice if you want to stay central, sleep and eat well and have a great quality rest. The staff were super, very organized and kind. The only thing I might could be picky about is the 'fake fish tank' on Telly,there's better and more realistic ones out there ;) overall this Mayfair gem rocks",
      "Stayed in room with kitchenette, 2 doubles and sofa sleeper. Quite roomy, cute with patio set on balcony outside room. Can walk down to beach, within 1 block away. Numerous restaurants, shops within walking distance also. Continental breakfast scant, with coffee and sweets, but only negative I experienced there. Kitchen had full size stove and fridge. Easy drive to seaworld and maritime museum. Unfortunately weather was cold and rainy during our 3 days there, so put a damper on our visit. Didn't get to see as much as we wanted to. We loved the maritime museum and harbor cruise and my boys couldn't get enough of the USS Midway museum! I would definately return to this nice little inn!",

      "Like many reviewers, we have enjoyed afternoon tea in various establishments but none meet the impeccable standards of the Dorchester. From the attentive, friendly and efficient service to the delicious treats, the whole afternoon left us with a warm glow which matched our surroundings. Imagine sinking into your most favourite comy sofa, a pianist skilfully playing at just the right volume, a gentle, smiling face offering you any tea of your choosing with delicate offerings of sandwiches, pastries and scones. Add to that, the joys of conversation with friends of some thirty years and you have a recipe for a perfect afternoon. The most skilful of service kept the pace moving so that we left in time for them to set up for the final sitting. Of course it would have been great to stay and linger but why deny others this delightful experience.",

Though we made reservations for a partial view, I believe we received a slight upgrade...as our view was wonderful.

      "This hotel was chosen for its location and cost. The booking process on the sarova website was simple. We chose the Classic room and were allocated 641 on the sixth floor. The room overlooked the front of the hotel with the Victoria and Albert museum in front of us and Harrods further down the road to the right. Quite small but very adequate with a nice bathroom with whirlpool bath. A safe was also provided which helps with security, together with a complimentary tray for hot drinks. I thought that the mini bar was quite expensive. Breakfast was included in our nightly rate and this was fresh and plentiful, almost a meal to set you up for the day. | One minor niggle was that the room was not ready at 2pm, but we only had to wait 20 minutes and was worth it. I would definitely use this hotel again.",
      "I booked directly via the hotel's website and was given a great deal on the most expensive suite. I was in London to celebrate my birthday with friends. Arriving on a Saturday, the City is fairly deserted over the weekend. The hotel is spotless, the staff is warm, efficient and eager to meet all your needs and manages to remain unobtrusive. The room was large by London standard's. My only quibble is that we were denied access to the rather large terrace outside our room for reasons that were never really made clear upon check-in. All the amenities were top-notch: huge flat screen tvs, multiple outlets, fabulous bedding and beds, iron &amp; ironing board, and one of the best hotel showers I have ever used. I look forward to staying here again.",
      "We have stayed in many of the downtown Seattle hotels from the hip to the old school and this is by far the best hotel - great service, airy and well appointed rooms - everything works like it should in this price range. We especially liked the location - you can walk everywhere and the neighborhood around this hotel feels safer than some other downtown areas... the hotel is especially convenient to the light rail network so an easy trio in from the airport and a short walk.Our only minor quibble (and this is minor in the big scheme of things, but an area Hyatt may want to look at) is charging a 1/bottle of drinking water - in a 300+/night hotel the water should be free and plentiful!",
