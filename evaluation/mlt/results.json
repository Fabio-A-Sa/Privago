      "We had looked around the area for an affordable yet clean hotel during our trips to Disneyland. We tend to stay overnight at least once a month in the area. We had stayed in several of the neighboring hotels and found them to be acceptable. In December of 2102 I booked several rooms at the Del Sol Inn for our family. I was very pleased with the staff during our check in process, who made us feel welcome. They were also very accommodating with our large group. The rooms are large and clean. The parking is good and the pool is very nice. Over all I have returned to the Del Sol Inn twice more and plan to us this as our favorite area hotel. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.",
      "Went to San Diego to drop our daughter off at college. Hilton Garden Inn was by far the best value. We stayed three nights. Centrally located, quite, freeway accessible and a great staff. Room was large as we had four in our family. Pool and workout space were great. Ate two nights at the restrauant as we were so busy. Happy hour was a little expensive but not compared to other hotels I guess. Will be back. Dear Joe F, Thank you for your wonderful review of the Hilton Garden Inn San Diego Mission Valley Stadium! We are so proud to have a great team of associates who are eager to provide our guests with top notch service. We hope to become your favorite destination when your business or leisure bring you to San Diego! Take care till next time!Warm regards,Sammie",

      "Fantastic location, reasonable price, and helpful staff made London the favorite stop during our European trek. | Mr. Rees, his family, and staff could not have been more helpful. We stayed in the hotel the nights of Christmas eve and Christmas. What a wonderful surprise when Mrs. Rees came to our room on Christmas eve with several presents and treats! It was very heartwarming, especially since we missed being with the rest of our family on the holiday. | The hot breakfast was great (thankfully, no beans!). My sons and I had to leave very early on 26-Dec and the staff came in early just to prepare our breakfast. What service! | Hotel is in a perfect location to see everything in London. Close to the tube system, as well as the Pancras train station. | Thank you to the Rees family and the whole staff at the Ridgemount Hotel!",
      "We visited here as a family at Easter . The service was fabulous from everybody we came into contact with . We actually took afternoon tea which was a relaxed affair and not rushed. I've had afternoon tea both here and the Ritz this year and this was by far my favourite | The cakes were more interesting the bread not dry , also although you have an allotted time in both . You do not feel rushed at the savoy the turning if tables is far more subtle | The savoy currently have a fab rate on suites . Stay two nights and the second night is PS20.15 .

The outside pool is nice and has fantastic food service, although a bit overpriced. The hotel is decorated in a retro style which we all appreciated. They even have a beach service where the staff will bring out lounge chairs and set up a beach umbrella for their guests. I'm sure we'll be back.",

(Jetlag sucks!) luckily the room had a superb set of blinds turning a sunny day into a pitch black night. 45 park lane is an excellent choice if you want to stay central, sleep and eat well and have a great quality rest. The staff were super, very organized and kind. The only thing I might could be picky about is the 'fake fish tank' on Telly,there's better and more realistic ones out there ;) overall this Mayfair gem rocks",
      "Stayed in room with kitchenette, 2 doubles and sofa sleeper. Quite roomy, cute with patio set on balcony outside room. Can walk down to beach, within 1 block away. Numerous restaurants, shops within walking distance also. Continental breakfast scant, with coffee and sweets, but only negative I experienced there. Kitchen had full size stove and fridge. Easy drive to seaworld and maritime museum. Unfortunately weather was cold and rainy during our 3 days there, so put a damper on our visit. Didn't get to see as much as we wanted to. We loved the maritime museum and harbor cruise and my boys couldn't get enough of the USS Midway museum! I would definately return to this nice little inn!",

      "Like many reviewers, we have enjoyed afternoon tea in various establishments but none meet the impeccable standards of the Dorchester. From the attentive, friendly and efficient service to the delicious treats, the whole afternoon left us with a warm glow which matched our surroundings. Imagine sinking into your most favourite comy sofa, a pianist skilfully playing at just the right volume, a gentle, smiling face offering you any tea of your choosing with delicate offerings of sandwiches, pastries and scones. Add to that, the joys of conversation with friends of some thirty years and you have a recipe for a perfect afternoon. The most skilful of service kept the pace moving so that we left in time for them to set up for the final sitting. Of course it would have been great to stay and linger but why deny others this delightful experience.",

The Hacienda is a beautiful hotel, the grounds are breathtaking, the area is safe, the hotel rooms are clean, and the staff are very friendly, especially McKenzy.

      "My wife and I have stayed at many bed-and-breakfasts on Gower Street since our first visit to London in 1964; and this one is by far the best. Even the e-mails when I was making bookings were personal and friendly. | The establishment is spotlessly clean, and the staff are pleasant and friendly. The owner knows how to get to different places, and is happy to share his knowledge. The lounge is open all night ... with a computer. Free coffee and tea at all times. | If you need to complain about something, the showers are a bit cramped and the traffic is a bit noisy. If you truly need to complain, stay home!",

      "The Holiday Inn Express New York City Times Square serves its purpose. It is a very comfortable, no frills, clean hotel in the heart of Manhattan. Their free breakfast has many selections. My only complaint is that the two elevators do not service the 30+ floors very efficiently.Dear DavidBa928,We appreciate you choosing our hotel for your accommodation needs and for taking the time to share you feedback with the Trip Advisor community. Its great to see our location was convenient for your activities and that you enjoyed our amenities. We apologize for any delays you may have experienced with our elevators, but we appreciate your patience and understanding. We hope to have you stay with us again in the future and wish you safe travels!Sincerely,Team Holiday Inn Express Times Square",
      "We stayed at this hotel as a stop over point on our family vacation to Door County Wisconsin. The hotel was easy to find and our front desk check-in process was quick and easy. The staff is very friendly and helpful! We booked with a package from Marriot that included parking and a 3 day transit pass. If you plan to go downtown it is a little bit of a long train ride but much easier than driving there! The rooms were clean and comfortable. They are a little small but you never feel cramped. The pool area is beautiful and room was on the ground floor with direct access. I would highly reccomend this hotel for pleasure or business!"

Our flight was pushed back so we ended up arriving in Seattle at 7 in the morning. They accommodated us and had our room ready at 9 am so that we could check in early and get some sleep before starting our day. The room was very clean, quaint, and cozy. We didn't hear another guest at all. It did get a little loud on Friday night, but it is a popular area with many bars and restaurants so it was to be expected. Ear plugs were provided and there was really no problems. We loved our stay here! We definitely will stay here again!",

No use calling maintenance as they will not be able to fix it.

This was the cheapest place in the City and it was really easy for me to get downtown. They were fast in calling me a cab when I needed it and friendly when I asked about restaurants in the area. The rooms are a little dated but hey-you get what you pay for so I can't really complain. It was a clean and decent place. I will stay here again when I'm back.",

All around a lovely place to stay. The staff were lovely. Breakfast was ok. You need to get there early as once they run out of things they don't seem to have any more eg certain cereals, muffins, pastries etc. It was however a lovely place to stay.We are so pleased to hear you've enjoyed your stay with us!

We stayed at the Ridgemount In March for three nights. Had 2 double rooms at rear of the building and we did not notice any noise. The rooms were small as expected but very clean and the beds were comfortable. The breakfasts were very good. The owners were very helpful.

Bedding was great, no stains on the carpet, bathroom was very nice and clean. I didn't have the opportunity to dine in the hotel so I can't comment on restaurants or food. Front desk staff was very friendly.The only negative, which I didn't notice but others in my group did, was the noise coming from the open restaurant areas in the lobby. Seems that during functions rooms on upper floors (one person in our group was on the 7th floor) the sound travels up the elevator shaft.....just a guess. But again, I had no issues at all.Thank you for staying with us and sharing your experience. We hope to see you back again soon!"
