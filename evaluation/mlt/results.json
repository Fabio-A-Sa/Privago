      "The Historic French Market Inn, 5th year. I was recognized as a returning guest from a first class staff. A solo, this trip, I felt safe. Room with balcony, famous landmarks a short walk away. I/we will return again and again because of their location, beautiful interior, cleanliness, staff, and the restaurant soon to open. I rode the trolley from the depot to Canal and Decatur St. then three blocks to the hotel. Trolley cost was 40 cents senior citizen discount.Hi Maureen, thank you so much for choosing The French Market Inn and taking the time to share this valuable feedback. Were glad that you enjoyed your stay with us in New Orleans, and look forward to welcoming you back soon!",
      "The staff and accommodations at the Orlando Airport Hilton Garden Inn are consistently excellent. I have been staying at the hotel for approximately two years on a regular basis and both the pre-arrival and the stay are a positive experience each time I stay the hotel.My staff and I thank you for making the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport hotel your home away from home. As a General Manager I was so delighted to know that we have succeeded in our efforts of providing you with exceptional service, clean and comfortable facilities again and again. This is the best compliment a General Manager can have. I would love the chance to meet you in person when you do return again. Looking forward to welcoming you back soon.Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport",
      "When you pay 850 quids for a night, you sort of expect the room to be ready when you check in at the 3pm advertized time. If the room is not ready, which might happen, you sort of expect not to be let to dry off on a chair without an offer for a complimentary glass of water or cup of coffee. The rest was ok, great yet smallish room with zero view contrarily to what I was led to believe, perfect service. As with so many such top notch 5**** hotels, if you only stay for a night, you're a 2nd class citizen compared to their uber-wealthy long-stay customers. Quid for quid, Holiday Inn is probably a better option.",
      "This hotel is FABULOUS! Newly remodeled and soooo clean!!! The best part of this hotel is the staff inside of it!!!! They are the heart and soul of this hotel!!!! You feel as though you are a family member! Dear Lacometti,Thank you for your wonderful review of the Hilton Garden Inn Mission Valley Stadium in San Diego! We are so proud to have a great team of associates who are eager to provide our guests with top notch service. We hope you will be able to come back and visit or if you have friends or family visiting you, we would be gracious to have them as our honored guests as well. Please take care until next time!Warm regards,Sammie.",
      "Everyone was grumbling about the past places we had held our family reunions and so ( because I am a Christmas Tree grower) I suggested we try Santa Claus Indiana - and we found Santa's Lodge!!!! What a great facility - I could have stayed there all the time and still feel like I'd been entertained, pampered, and made to... More",
      "This Quality Inn is about average compared to other Quality Inns. It's clean and convenient. The reason my review isn't higher is because the room didn't have enough towels, and appeared the maid just never finished it. The hallway hadn't been vacuumed in a long time. Soda machine on the third floor didn't work and the front day person seemed... More",
      "This was a cute inn in a perfect location! I was thrilled when I found such a bargain for a place to stay in such an ideal part of the city! We walked to the fishermans wharf and ghiradelli square in just a few minutes. The rooms were clean and spacious. Will def be back the next time i'm in the city!",
      "The College Club of Boston is well-established, and has beautiful bedrooms which are very comfortable indeed...I booked a single room with shared bath, and was delighted to be ungraded to a large double room with private bath...The whole place smacked of class, and intellect...I just loved it...Edith the Club Secretary, and Donald, the resident Caretaker, were lovely people, ready to almost anything to help, and I felt very much at home...I shall definitely return to no 426 which I am reliably told is one of the best rooms in the house!Jane,Thanks for your kind words! We look forward to seeing you again as time permits.",
      "As I've come to know, the Hilton Garden Inn brand is very good for an overnight stay or a several-night stay. the reception is very welcoming, offering waters and other drinks. The in-house cafe is a great help when there isn't time to get to another restaurant. Room-wise, I've found the suites to be very comfortable and quiet. I would definitely book at a Hilton Garden Inn again.",
      "Loved the location of the French Market Inn right on Decatur, yet away from all the noise. The room was extremely comfortable for both of us. Bathroom was impeccable. Wi-fi was perfect and of course we loved Patrick! I just wish there was a complimentary water for the first night.Thank you for choosing the French Market Inn and taking the time to share your valuable feedback. Please know that all of your comments have been passed on to our management team for review.

Freshly made omeletes and delicious buffet choices every morning, While other Hyatts also have the same breakfast, this location goes above and beyond with the quality care they put into the service. It makes having to work while in Seattle, a pleasure.Darcie E,It was a pleasure to have you as our guest recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and it is exciting to hear that you found the staff to be helpful and inviting.

      "My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary weekend as a treat, but what a treat it was. The dinner, bed and breakfast package was great value and the food and service were outstanding. We had breakfast in the room, all served for us, and were upgraded to an Executive room which was large and lavish. All the details were there, this place is simply amazing.

It is close to everything in the Quarter and very reasonable. Miss Minnie in the morning and Miss Nancy in the evening will take good care of you. Also, make sure you stop at Walgreens to get your Jazzy pass. For 9 per person you can ride the bus streetcars for three days like a native.
