My standard room was very spacious and beautiful, and the view out my window of the London Eye was a lovely bonus. The staff were very helpful and I was able to arrange both early check-in and late check-out, which met my needs. The concierge desk was also helpful in advising me on what sites were feasible is not in the limited time I had available.",

Valet parking on arrival was so easy and convenient, and the price of parking actually very reasonable and what you would expect for a hotel in the centre of London. The location was brilliant, easy access to Blackfriars tube station, and also easy to walk to sights such as St Paul's cathedral, and the Tate is just around the corner. The Sea Containers bar was great, with a lovely view across London, well worth a visit for some cocktails even if you're not staying in the hotel! The room was fantastic, fully equipped with everything we needed (and more!), really clean and lovely decor. Would definitely stay here again on future visits to London.",
