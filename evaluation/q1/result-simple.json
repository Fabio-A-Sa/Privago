      "This is one of the finest hotels we have ever stayed in. The service staff was amazing, the rooms luxurious and the fitness center and spa were gorgeous. The location was also perfect for sightseeing: minutes from The London Eye, Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden. We made the mistake to try to stay in another hotel to experience a different area of London on the third leg of our itinerary (see my other review), we would have been 1000% happier here."

You are in the center of London. Just few steps from Marble Arch/ Oxford street, but still very quite place to stay. I could suggest this hotel for romantic weekend. :)"

      "Already my second stay here within only a few months! one of the reasons I chose to come back to London to celebrate my sisters birthday here. Favorite hotel here with the most wonderful, kind staff. Very central with easy access everywhere! :) (the central line and waterloo line etc, leaves from almost right behind the hotel) close to many restaurants. Rooms are very quiet and have a calm nice vibe and are quite big considered it's quite in the center of London. Went there this time for my sisters birthday and we had an amazing time thanks to their lovely staff! Everything went so smoothly and got a nice upgrade and the most wonderful welcome. Even better than I had expected. | Everything is possible and the reception is there for you 24/7. Highly recommend. Thank you!"
