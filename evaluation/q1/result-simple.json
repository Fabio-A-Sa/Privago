The hotel staff was incredibly kind and helped us for any kind of problems: restaurant reservation, taxis, traffic information..you can ask really everything and you'll have a perfect answer. The room was very clean and perfectly equipped. The wellness center was over the top, after walking all day around London it was a pleasure going just downstairs to the amazing spa. | I suggest to have breakfast there 'cause it's THE best breakfast that I've ever had..I mis it already! | A must go!"
